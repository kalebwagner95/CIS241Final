<h2 style="text-align: center">Bartending</h2>
<img src="../images/bartending.jpg" alt="Bartender pouring a cocktail" class="center">
<p>Bartending is not only my current career, but it is actually a passion of mine.
I don't actually drink alcohol, but it is extremely interesting to me. It has been a centerpiece of
humanity for as long as history has been recorded. I have a ton of fun finding new ways to combine ingredients
and entertain people. I find alcohol interesting because you can find enjoyment in it whether
you barely scratch the surface, and enjoy a light beer once a month, or if you dive deep and
drink craft cocktails with homemade syrups, shrubs, high-end liquors, or if you like to sip
expensive whiskey neat.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Golf</h2>

<p>I recently started golfing this Summer, and have been absolutely addicted ever since. I haven't been going
as much since it's not been sunny and warm, but I was golfing <em>at least</em> once a week when I started.
I've golfed all around the greater Seattle area, and can't wait to go on golf trips all around the country
this coming Spring/Summer.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Mountain Biking</h2>

<p>
Mountain Biking is something that I've been interested in since I was a kid, but never really got into it because
it is very expensive. In 2019, I was able to save up enough to get a decent mountain bike for around $1,000, and I fell in love
It's extremely dangerous and gets your adrenaline going like nothing else I've ever done. However, for those same
reasons, I haven't mountain biked much since 2019. I took a few hard falls (luckily without serious injury) and realized
how risky it is. Someone like me who works in the service industry, I need my limbs to work properly in order to work.
Not only would the hospital bills be super expensive, but paying my other bills would be difficult too. I still will continue
to bike for the foreseeable future, but I will have to take it easy.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Bowling</h2>
<img src="../images/bowling.jpg" alt="Bowler watching the ball strike the pins" class="center">
<p>
In early 2018 I started working at a bowling alley in bellingham as a side-job while I went to school. I immediately found out that
there is a subculture of people who take bowling very seriously. I really enjoy sports and activities where you are competing against yourself,
and bowling usually has a handicap system built in. I started bowling in leagues, and fell in love with it. Over the first few league
nights, your scores are tracked and averaged out. This average is then used to calculate how many "free points" you get. The purpose of this is
so that if you bowl better than you usually do, you will win, even if the person you are bowling against bowls a better game than you, but bowls below
their own average. This concept of not needing to beat your opponents, but needing to beat yourself hooked me.
