My name is Kaleb Wagner. I grew up in the Lynnwood/Edmonds area, and have attended Edmonds College since it was called a community College.
I first attended a program through the college called EdCap, which is short for Edmonds Career
Access Program. It's essentially an alternative high school program, but if you "game the system" you can
get a bunch of college credits for free. I attended EdCap for a few years, slowly accumulating college credits
before moving to Bellingham with the hopes of attending WWU. There were a few complications that led to me taking
a few years away from school. I moved back to the Lynnwood area about a year ago, and have been attending Edmonds College
since then.

I currently work as a bartender/server at a restaurant on the waterfront in Edmonds called Demetri's Woodstone Taverna. I've been bartending for a few
years and I absolutely love it. I get to be creative with cocktails, and constantly try new things. If we're in a rush, and I have to make 12 cocktails, pour 8 beers, 2 glasses of wine,
and serve a bottle of wine, it feels like a puzzle. It's a constant game of trying to be as efficient as possible while serving quality drinks. During slow times, I get to entertain guests
while helping them find a cocktail that suits their palate, or design one on the spot with there preferences in mind. The coworkers in the service industry are a unique bunch of people.
The industry attracts a certain type of crazy person and they're what make it so enjoyable. The 32 year-old felon line cook with 4 daughters is sure to have a crazy tale or two if you give
him a chance to tell you.

In addition to my school and work life, I recently got into golf! I started golfing in June of this year, and <strong>instantly</strong> got addicted. There's something so satisfying
when you strike the ball well. It makes this unmistakable sound, and flies through the air in a way that makes all of the other bad shots not matter. It's a <strong>very</strong>
difficult game, but that's a big reason I'm drawn to it. Another big reason, is that it's time outside with your friends. I've only played courses in this area, but I've played at:
Legion Memorial Park, City of Lynnwood Municipal Golf Course, Jackson Park Golf Course, Jefferson Park Golf Course, Walter E. Hall Golf Course, and Nile Shrine Golf Course.
