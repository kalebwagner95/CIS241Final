I learned a lot this quarter about HTML and CSS. I've done quite a bit of "web development" when it comes to wordpress.
I designed, built, and wrote content for a personal project website and wrote over 50,000 words worth of content. When I was actively maintaining
the website, it was attracting over 10,000 views/mo. However, the amount of actual html and css I used were very little. I remember I used an online "button generator"
to give me the css for a good looking button, and I used little things like &lt;br&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; in the html editor to help with formatting.
However, all of the main styling was done through wordpress themes which are like templates that you can simply adjust to your needs.
</p>
<p>
In this class, I learned a lot about how html and css interact, and how directory structure works. It is quite surprising to learn that websites are essentially just
directories of files that are held on a host server so that they are accessible from anywhere.
<br>
It feels good to now have a better understanding of the behind-the-scenes of my wordpress websites, and I will now have
greater flexibility in customization of them.
</p>

<p>
The labs we worked on were especially educational, as seeing the pages change before my eyes really helped solidify the things we learned in the readings.
The concept in the labs where I felt the most lost, and consequentially felt I learned the most was internal linking. It took a while to fully understand that
you can give and "id" attribute to other elements, and then just link to them using #"id" as the value for the href attribute of an "a" element.

</p>

<p>
Overall I really enjoyed this class, and learned a lot. I never felt annoyed or upset that I had labs or othe homework to do. (However, I do admit that discussions are
not my favorite) Every assignment felt beneficial and interesting and didn't feel like busy-work.
